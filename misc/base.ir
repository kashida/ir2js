Making closure compiler think we are doing inheritance (it doesn't seem to
understand Object.create).
Specifically, child class with @struct doesn't see parent's @struct unless we
use this.
:
  goog := goog || {}
  goog.inherits = ##
    childCtor\O\$
    parentCtor\O\$
    childCtor.prototype = Object.create(parentCtor.prototype)
